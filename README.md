# Totality Frontend Challenge

## Project Overview
This project is a frontend application built as a part of the Totality Frontend Challenge. The application showcases a list of properties with images, descriptions, and details such as price, location, and amenities.

## Tech Stack
- **React**: Used for building the UI and managing component state.
- **Firebase**: Used for hosting and managing backend functionality (if applicable).
- **Netlify**: The application is deployed on Netlify for easy hosting and deployment.
- **JavaScript (ES6+)**: Core programming language used.
- **HTML5/CSS3**: Markup and styling.

## Approach
- The project uses React to render a list of properties with dynamic data.
- Static images for the properties are stored in the `public/images` folder.
- Each property object contains details such as title, description, price, location, and amenities, which are rendered dynamically in the UI.

## Deployment
The application is deployed on Netlify. You can view the live version [here](#).

## How to Run Locally
To run the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone (https://github.com/Jaslyn10/totality-frontend-challenge.git)
-Navigate to the project directory:

## Additional Notes
The images are located in the public/images folder.
Make sure to restart the development server after adding new images

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
